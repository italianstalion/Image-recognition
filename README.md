# Image-recognition
This is the Matlab code and idea of Image recognition System using Machine learning 
ALL THE CODES ARE WRITTEN IN MATLAB LANGUAGE SEPERATELY.
ALL THE CODES ARE RECALLED IN THE ex3.m CODE.
WHILE RUNNING THE ex3.m ALL THE WRITTEN CODES ARE RECALLED ONE BY ONE AND AT THE END YOU WILL SEE THE OUTPUT.
I HAVE GIVEN THE INPUT FILE TO THE CODE.
THE INPUT FILE IS ex3data.mat .
FIRST ALL THE IMAGES IN THE INPUT FILE ARE NOT VISIBLE CLEARLY.
WITHOUT USING THIS ALGORITHM THE SYSTEM WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THE INPUT.
BY USING THIS ALGO THE SYSTEM WILL RUN THE ONE VS ALL ALGO.BECAUSE OF THAT THE SYSTEM WILL LEARN ALL THE INPUT LETTERS OR NUMBER AND PREDICT THE OUTPUT FOR THE UNRECOGNIZABLE INPUT FILE.
